This is a Python program code where the user must match his facial expression to the emotional display that will be displayed randomly by the program.
In this program, users are required to complete the game by imitating the emojis displayed. For each similar expression, 10 points will be added and 
when our points reach 200, a picture will be taken from the camera and saved in the **./image** directory as a form of achievement for completing the game.

This program uses a machine learning model to predict the form of emotion that is input in the form of a camera. For face detection, this program uses 
OpenCV with Haar Cascade Face Detector as a face detector.

The following are various types of images that represent human emotions as a reference for users to imitate their expressions.
